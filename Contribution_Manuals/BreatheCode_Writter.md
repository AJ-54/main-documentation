# Contributing as a BreatheCode Writer

Hi! :smile: Thanks for helping us to conceptualize and explain all BreatheCode projects to the community. If you feel that there is a gap in our documentation, you can participate and contribute to improve the project. Keep in mind that what is describe is not a compilation of rules but a guide for submitting any suggestion and make sure the community understand your information and find related issues/suggestions. Remember, even if youâ€™re not the developer type, contributing to the documentation is still of huge value.

## What kind of contributions do we expect as a BreatheCode Writer?

- **Creating new documentation** as projects descriptions, wikis, README files, technical documentation, or release notes to describe  changes.
- **Updating documentation**: submit a whole update document (to change it, and then resubmit the whole document), or make partial updates (to relink, add further and latest information to previous documentation) by fixing broken links and spelling/grammatical errors and documenting a change to an existing file/contribution.
- **Enhancing documentation**: Put yourself in the readers' place. Contribute to create a more easy-reading document. Ideally, readers should be able to grasp the overall structure and quickly find what they want. Think of graphic design as a delivery system for ideas (add images, charts, tables... where it is precise).
