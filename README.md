# Welcome to BreatheCode

Hello, my name is :blush: [Alejandro Sanchez](https://alesanchezr.com) I'm the founder of BreatheCode, thank you for taking the time to read this!  :smile:

> BreatheCode's mission is to **accelerate the way junior developers learn and evolve** using technology.

### BreatheCode's code is divided in 4 main verticals:
- **Tools**: Stuff you can download and use to learn how to build software faster.
- **Libraries**: Some libraries targeted to fix recurrent coding challenges like: Session Management, Notifications, etc.
- **Apps**: We build software for teaching purposes only.
- **APIs**: Assets for teachers.
If you want to learn more about our current projects and developments look at the end of the document.

## Are you here to contribute?
Great! You can contribute to BreatheCode in four different ways:
- **BreatheCode Coder**: Join the development of any particular project, the majority of our repositories are being actively maintain and with new versions on the pipeline. Read this [if you want to become a **BreatheCode Coder**](#).
- **BreatheCode Writer**: Help us explain everything to the community: What projects are available? how do they work? how to use them? Here is a more detailed guide you should read if you want to [become a **BreatheCode Writer**](#).
- **BreatheCode Inspector**: Report issues you find on the application or any improvements you would like. Here is how to report a bug or request a new feature on any of **BreatheCode projects**.
- **BreatheCode Fixer**: There are a lot of issues revolving around our libraries, it is really hard fix them all and more keep showing up :disappointed_relieved: Here is a small guide on how to help us solve bugs!

## Our current projects
Like I said above, BreatheCode is divided in 4 types of projects:
### 1. Tools
In real life you use a lot of tools to code, like: Git, NPM, etc. We have proposed 2 additional tools for junior developers:
 
  - [C9 Plugin](https://github.com/breatheco-de/c9-plugin): Cloud 9 is a great IDE for junior developers because it allow you to work with very few configurations no an isolated machine. We have created a plugin to enhance the Cloud 9 coding IDE and integrated with all the other BreatheCode projects.
  
  - [BreatheCode CLI](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli): Command Line interface to connect with lots of useful stuff like access to boilerplates, exercises, builders, etc.

3. Libraries: Very focused libraries to resolve recurring issues during developments.
  - [React Session](https://github.com/breatheco-de/react-session): Allows persistent sessions in react, compatible with react router.
  - [React Notifier](https://github.com/breatheco-de/react-notifier): Notification library for React Applications.
  - [React Flux Dash](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-flux-dash): Flux implementation for React.js

4. Web Applications:
 
  - [CMS](https://github.com/breatheco-de/desktop-client): This is were most of the community content is being published: Lessons, Error Explanations and "How to's".
  - [Student Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/desktop-client): BreatheCode's main website for displaying the courses.
  - [Teacher Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/teacher-client): Teachers are able to manage the pace of their cohorts, review students deliverables, etc.
  - [Admin Web Client](https://github.com/breatheco-de/admin-client): Manage BreathCode students, teachers, etc.

|  :blue_book: Technologies: Gatsby.js, React.js, FLUX, Fetch, CSS, SASS and HTML. |

6. API's:
  - [Platform API](https://api.breatheco.de): The API for the LMS, it manages students, courses, etc.
  - [Assets API](https://assets.breatheco.de): Amazing resources for students (infographics, lessons, cheat-sheets, mock api's, etc).
 ```txt
 :blue_book: Technologies: PHP, SlimPHP, EloquentORM, MySQL, SQLite, JSON, Static Files, REST.
