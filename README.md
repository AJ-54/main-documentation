# Welcome to BreatheCode

Our mission is to create tools to teach how to code in a professional way.

You can contribute to BreatheCode in two different ways:
- **BreatheCode Coder**: Join the development of any particular project, the majority of our repositories are being actively maintain and with new versions on the pipeline. [Here is a more detailed guide you should read](#) if you want to become a **BreatheCode Coder**.
- **BreatheCode Writer**: Help us explain everything to the community: What projects are available? how do they work? how to use them? Here is a more detailed guide you should read if you want to [become a **BreatheCode Writer**](#).
- *Report bugs or feature requests*: Report issues you find on the application or any improvements you would like.
