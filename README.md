# Welcome to BreatheCode

Hello, my name is [Alejandro Sanchez](https://alesanchezr.com) I'm the founder of BreatheCode, thank you for taking the time to read this!  
BreatheCode's mission is to **accelerate the way junior developers learn and evolve** using technology.

To accomplish that we use all the possible means of technology.

## How to contribute
You can contribute to BreatheCode in two different ways:
- **BreatheCode Coder**: Join the development of any particular project, the majority of our repositories are being actively maintain and with new versions on the pipeline. Read this [if you want to become a **BreatheCode Coder**](#).
- **BreatheCode Writer**: Help us explain everything to the community: What projects are available? how do they work? how to use them? Here is a more detailed guide you should read if you want to [become a **BreatheCode Writer**](#).
- **Report bugs or feature requests**: Report issues you find on the application or any improvements you would like. Here is how to report a bug or request a new feature on any of **BreatheCode projects**.
- **Debugging**: There are a lot of issues revolving around our libraries, it is really hard fix them all and more keep showing up :disappointed_relieved: Here is a small guide on how to help us solve bugs!
